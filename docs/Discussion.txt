Client-side JavaScript validation is helpful because it gives users instant feedback and reduces the 
load on the server. However, servers should not fully trust the data coming from a form since client-side
validation can be skipped.Users might turn off JavaScript, change the form data using developer tools, or 
directly send request to the server without using the form. That's why server-side validation is important
to keep the data safe and accurate.
